Learn more at [RK3399 Product Page](http://www.rock-chips.com/a/en/products/RK33_Series/2016/0419/758.html).



### PMIC

The PMIC on ROCK960 is RK805, a companion PMIC for RK3399 by Rockchip.

The RK805 is a complete power supply solution for portable systems. The highly integrated device includes four buck DC-DC converters, three high performance ldos, I2C interface, programmable power sequencing and an RTC.

The RK805 improves performance, reduces component count and size, and therefore provides lower cost solution compared to conventional portable designs. The ultra fast 2MHz current mode DC/DC architecture optimizes the transient performance and is compatible with tiny low cost ceramic inductors and capacitors. All DC/DC channels include integrated MOSFETS. Internal soft-start and compensation circuits minimize external components count. Most outputs can be programmed through the I2C interface

The RK805 integrates internal RC oscillator for low cost application which without RTC function.

### Memory (DRAM)

The ROCK960 Board provides 2GB(model A) or 4GB(model B) LPDDR3-SDRAM which is a 2-channel and 32bit width bus implementation interfacing directly to the RK3399 build-in LPDDR controller. The maximum DDR clock is 933MHz. It's soldered on board and not replaceable.

### Storage

The ROCK960 Board provides an 16GB(model A) or 32GB(model B) EMMC which is compliant with EMMC 5.1.

### Micro SDHC

The ROCK960 Board SD slot signals are routed directly to the RK3399 SDIO interface. It meets the SD3.0 standard.

### Boot ROM

The ROCK960 Board can boot up from the EMMC or the Micro SD card. If a bootable Micro SD card is inserted, ROCK960 will boot from Micro SD card and ignore the EMMC. If the Micro SD card is not inserted or non-bootable(ie. as storage media). The ROCK960 will try to boot from EMMC. If there is no bootable image in EMMC, the board will go to Maskrom mode and wait for USB command from host.

### Networking

#### WiFi

The wifi/bt module used on ROCK960s is AP6356s from AMPAK Technology. The AP6356s module complies with IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO standard and it can achieve up to a speed of 867Mbps with dual stream in 802.11n to connect the wireless LAN.

### UART {0/1}

- The 96Boards specifications calls for a 4-wire UART implementation, UART0 and an optimal second 2-wire UART, UART1 on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- The ROCK960 Board implements UART0 as a 4-wire UART that connects directly to the RK3399 SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.
- The ROCK960 Board implements UART1 as a 2-wire UART that connects directly to the RK3399 SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.

### I2C {0/1}

- The 96Boards specification calls for two I2C interfaces to be implemented on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- The ROCK960 Board implements both interfaces named I2C1 and I2C6. They connect directly to the RK3399 SoC.

### GPIO {A-L}

The 96Boards specification calls for 12 GPIO lines to be implemented on the Low Speed Expansion Connector. Some of these GPIOs may support alternate functions for DSI/CSI control

The ROCK960 board implements this requirement. All GPIOs are routed to the RK3399 SoC. Refer the Low Speed Expansion Connector table for GPIO A-L signals. The GPIO of RK3399 has following features:

- All of GPIOs can be used to generate interrupt to CPU
- GPIO0 and GPIO1 can be used to wakeup system from low-power mode
- The pull direction(pull-up or pull-down) for all of GPIOs are software-programmable
- All of GPIOs are always in input direction in default after power-on-reset
- The drive strength for all of GPIOs is software-programmable

### SPI 0

- The 96Boards specification calls for one SPI bus master to be provided on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- The ROCK960 Board implements a full SPI master with 4 wires, CLK, CS, MOSI and MISO. The signals are connected directly to the RK3399 SoC and driven at 1.8V.

### PCM/I2S

- The 96Boards specification calls for one PCM/I2S bus to be provided on the Low Speed Expansion Connector. The CLK, FS and DO signals are required while the DI is optional.
- The ROCK960 Board implements a PCM/I2S interface with 4 wires, CLK, FS, DO and DI. The signals are connected directly to the RK3399 SoC and driven at 1.8V.  

### Power and Reset

- The 96Boards specification calls for a signal on the Low Speed Expansion Connector that can power on/off the board and a signal that serves as a board reset signal.
- The ROCK960 Board routes the PWR_BTN_N (named PMIC_PWRON on schematic) signal to the PWRON pin of the PMIC RK805. A mezzanine implementation of this signals should not drive it with any voltage, the only allowed operation is to force it to GND to start the board from a sleep mode.
- The ROCK960 Board routes the RST_BTN_N (named RESET_L on schematic) signal to the NRESPWRON pin of the PMIC RK805. This signal is also routes to SW2100, a push button for reset.


### Power Supplies

The 96Boards specification calls for three power rails to be present on the Low Speed Expansion Connector:
- +1.8V  Max of 100mA
- +5V  Provide a minimum of 5W of power (1A).

SYS_DCIN  8-18V input with enough current to support all the board functions or the output DCIN from on-board DC Connector able to provide a minimum of 7W of power.

The ROCK960 Board supports these requirements as follows:
- +1.8V  Driven by PMIC RK805 up to 2500mA.  It is the system main 1.8V power (VCC_1V8), and it can supply power up to 200mA to the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- +5V  Driven by a 3A pwm buck converter (SY8113B). It also provides the VBUS power to the two USB host connectors and the HDMI 5V power to the HDMI connector. The remaining capacity provides a max current of 2A to the Low Speed Expansion Connector, for a total of 10W which meets the 96Boards requirements.

SYS_DCIN  Can serves as the board’s main power source or can receive power from the board.

### MIPI DSI 0

- The 96Boards specification calls for a MIPI-DSI to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. A minimum of one lane is required and up to four lanes can be accommodated on the connector.
- The ROCK960 Board implementation supports a full four lane (1.2Gbps/lane) MIPI-DSI interface that is routed to the High Speed Expansion Connector. The MIPI-DSI signals are directly connected to MIPI TX/RX of RK3399.

### MIPI CSI {0/1}

- The 96Boards specification calls for two MIPI-CSI interfaces to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. Both interfaces are optional. CSI0 interface can be up to four lanes while CSI1 is up to two lanes.
- The ROCK960 Board implementation supports a full four lane MIPI-CSI interface on CSI0 and two lanes of MIPI-CSI on CSI1. All MIPI-CSI signals are routed directly to/from the RK3399 SoC.  CSI0 can support up to 13M@30fps and CSI1 can support up to 8M@30fps. The max data rate of each lane is 2.5Gbps.


### I2C {2/3}

- The 96Boards specification calls for two I2C interfaces to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector. Both interfaces are optional unless a MIPI-CSI interface has been implemented. Then an I2C interface shall be implemented.
- The ROCK960 Board implementation supports two MIPI-CSI interfaces and therefore must support two I2C interfaces. For MIPI-CSI0 the companion I2C2 is routed directly from the RK3399 SoC. For MIPI-CSI1, the companion I2C is I2C3. Each of the I2C line's pull up can be set from RK3399 internally.

### SD/SPI

- The 96Boards specification calls for an SD interface or a SPI port to be part of the High Speed Expansion Connector.
- The ROCK960 Board implements a full SPI master with 4 wires (96Boards SPI Configuration), CLK, CS, MOSI and MISO. All the signals are connected directly to the RK3399 SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.

### Clocks

- The 96Boards specification calls for one or two programmable clock interfaces to be provided on the High Speed Expansion Connector. These clocks may have a secondary function of being CSI0_MCLK and CSI1_MCLK. If these clocks can’t be supported by the SoC than an alternative GPIO or No-Connect is allowed by the specifications.
- The ROCK960 Board implements two CSI clocks which are connected directly to the RK3399 SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.

### USB

- The 96Boards specification calls for a USB Data line interface to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector.
- The ROCK960 Board implements this requirement by routing USB HOST1 of RK3399 to the High Speed Expansion Connector.

### HSIC

- The 96Boards specification calls for an optional MIPI-HSIC interface to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector.
- The ROCK960 Board implementation **doesn’t** support this optional requirement.

### Reserved

The pin 60 of the High Speed Expansion Connector is pulled up to VIO18_PMU via 100K resistor.

<img src="../additional-docs/images/images-hw-user-manual/rock960_power_tree.png" data-canonical-src="" width="800" />

### DC Power Input

- An 8V to 18V power from a dedicated DC jack.
- An 8V to 18V power from the SYS_DCIN pins on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.

> Note: Please refer to the mechanical size of the DC plug below.The inside diameter of the plug is 1.7mm，the outer diameter of the plug is 4.75mm.The positive electrode of the DC plug is in the inside, and the negative pole is outside.

### Power Source Selection

The user of the ROCK960 Board should never apply power to the board from DC jack and the Low Speed Expansion connector at the same time. There is no active or passive mechanism on the ROCK960 Board to prioritize one source over the other.
