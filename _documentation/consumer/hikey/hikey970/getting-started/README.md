## Starting the board for the first time

To start the board, follow these simple steps:

- Step 1. Connect the HDMI cable to the HiKey970 HDMI connector (marked J2001) and to the LCD Monitor.
- Step 2. Connect the keyboard to the boards USB connector marked J1901(or J1902) and the mouse to the USB connector marked J1902(or J1901).
- Step 3. Ensure that the boot switches SW2402 are set to ‘1000’, on/off/off/off position.
- Step 4. Connect the power supply to power connector J401.

Once you plug the power supply into a power outlet the board will start the booting process, and you should see Android boot up.
Please note that the first boot takes several minutes due to Androids initialization. Subsequent boot times should be faster.
