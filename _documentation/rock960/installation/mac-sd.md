####**Step 1**: Prepare MicroSD card

- Ensure data from mircoSD card is backed up
- Note: **Everything** on microSD card will be lost by the end of this procedure.

####**Step 2**: Find SD Card Device name

- You may need a MicroSD card adapter if your host computer only has an SD card slot
- On the host computer, open "Terminal" application **(Press Command+Space bar and type "Terminal")**
- Remove SD card from host computer and run the following command:
```shell
diskutil list
```
- Note all recognized disk names (example: /dev/disk1)
- **Insert SD card** and run the following command (again):
```shell
diskutil list
```
- Note the newly recognized disk. This will be your SD card.
- **Remember** your SD card device name, it will be needed in **Step 7**.

####**Step 3**: Recall Download Location

- Locate SD card install file that you got from Downloads page.
- This file will be needed for the next step.

####**Step 4**: Unzip _SD Card Install Image_

- Uncompress or unzip the _SD Card Install Image_ . With Mac OS X, you can use the Finder app to locate the file and then double click to automatically unzip the file.
- When unzipped, a folder (ex: rock960_ubuntu_server_16.04_arm64_20180115) will be created with the following contents:
   - Loader (rk3399_loader_v1.08.106.bin) we don't need it for SD card writing here.
   - An install Image (system.img) (ex: rock960_ubuntu_server_16.04_arm64_20180115.img)
   - readme.md

####**Step 5**: Go to directory with _SD Card Install Image_ folder using Terminal

- On the host computer, open the "Terminal" application **(Press Command+Space bar and type "Terminal")**
- `cd` to the directory with your unzipped **SD Card Install Image**

```shell
cd <extraction directory>

#Example: 
#<extraction directory> = /Users/YourUserName/Downloads
#For this example we assume the "SD Card Install Image" is in the Downloads folder.
cd /Users/YourUserName/Downloads
```

####**Step 6**: Locate SD Card Install Image

- Make sure you are in the extraction directory

**Unzipped SD Card download will be a folder. This folder should be found in your directory. Type `ls` from command line for a list of files that can be found in your current directory**:

```shell
ls

#output
rock960_ubuntu_server_16.04_arm64_20180115
```

- Unzipped folder should be called rock960_YY_arm64_XX, where Y can be Android or Debian and XX represents the release number
- `cd` into this directory

```shell
cd rock960_ubuntu_server_16.04_arm64_20180115
```

- Inside this folder you will find the install image.
   - `system.img`
- This `.img` file is what will be flashed or copied to your SD Card.

####**Step 7**: Flash Image onto SD Card

**Checklist:**

- SD card inserted into host computer
- Recall SD Card device name from [**Step 2**]()
- From within the `rock960_ubuntu_server_16.04_arm64_20180115` folder, using the Terminal execute the following commands:

**Execute:**

```shell
$ sudo dd if=system.img of=/dev/XXX bs=4m
$ sudo sync
```

**Note:**

- `if=system.img`: should match the name of the image that was downloaded.
- `of=/dev/XXX`: XXX should match the name of the SD Card device name from **Step 2**. Be sure to use the device name without the partition name. For example, 'of=/dev/disk1'
- If you get an error message "Resource Busy", you will need to unmount the SD card without removing it from the host computer. 
  - Option 1:
  - In the Applications folder, find and click on the Utilities folder. 
  - Click on the Disk Utility program to run it
  - Select the device that represents the SD card
  - Click on `unmount` and leave the SD card in the computer
  - Retry the '$ sudo dd if=system.img of=/dev/XXX bs=4m'
  - Option 2:
  - In the terminal window, enter this command:
```shell
$ sudo umount /dev/<device name>
```

- This command will take some time to execute. Be patient and avoid tampering with the terminal until process has ended.
- Once SD card is done flashing, remove from host computer and set aside for **Step 8** You may see a popup window that tells you the device is _Not readable by the operating system_. **Ignore the message** and remove the MicroSD card from the host computer.

####**Step 8**: Prepare ROCK960 with SD card

- Make sure ROCK960 is unplugged from power
- Connect an HDMI monitor to the ROCK960 with an HDMI cable, and power on the monitor
- Plug a USB keyboard and/or mouse into either of the two USB connectors on the ROCK960
- Insert the microSD card into the ROCK960
- Plug power adaptor into ROCK960, wait for board to boot up.

**Congratulations! You are now booting your newly installed operating system on SD card on the ROCK960!**
