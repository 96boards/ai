## Linux/macOS Host

This section show how to install a new operating system to ROCK960 on board eMMC using the [rkdeveloptool](http://opensource.rock-chips.com/wiki_Rkdeveloptool) on a Linux or macOS host computer.

***

- **Step 1**: Make sure rkdeveloptool is set up on host computer
- **Step 2**: Download all necessary images
- **Step 3**: Boot device into maskrom mode
- **Step 4**: Prepare the flash environment
- **Step 5**: Flash images onto ROCK960 eMMC and reboot

***

#### **Step 1**: Make sure rkdeveloptool is set up on host computer

##### Linux

To build rkdeveloptool on a debian based Linux distribution, follow the instructions below:

Install build dependency:

    sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev dh-autoreconf

Clone the source code and build:

    git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkdeveloptool
    cd rkdeveloptool
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make

Now you have rkdeveloptool executable at the current directory.

    sudo cp rkdeveloptool /usr/local/bin/

##### macOS

To build rkdeveloptool on macOS, you need [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)(or similar package manager) to install required packages.

Install build dependency:

    brew install automake autoconf libusb

Clone the source code and build:

    git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkdeveloptool
    cd rkdeveloptool
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make

Now you have rkdeveloptool executable at the current directory.

    sudo cp rkdeveloptool /usr/local/bin/

#### **Step 2**: Download all necessary images

Go to the [Downloads page](../downloads/README.md) to donwload the image.

Extract the image tar ball, for SD card/eMMC AIO image, the file list as below:

- rk3399_loader_v1.08.106.bin - run on target to init DRAM and flash, will not write to eMMC
- system.img - image contains bootloader/kernel/rootfs

#### **Step 3**: Boot device into maskrom mode

[Maskrom mode](http://opensource.rock-chips.com/wiki_Rockusb#Maskrom_mode) is the code inside the Rockchip SoC running and waiting for commands from USB when there is no external bootable media. To put the device into maskrom mode:

- power on rock960
- plug the rock960 to Linux desktop with USB type A to type C cable
- press and hold the maskrom key, then short press reset key

On the host PC, `lsusb` should show the following VID/PID if the board is in maskrom mode: `Bus 003 Device 061: ID 2207:0011`

**Note**: if no right USB device found, try:

1. Press and hold maskrom key longer, and short press and release reset key.

2. Check your usb cable, plug and unplug the usb cable, reverse plug the type C port and try.

#### **Step 4**: Prepare the flash environment

Run the following command to download and run the mini loader to init DRAM and prepare flashing environment:

    rkdeveloptool db rk3399_loader_v1.08.106.bin

#### **Step 5**: Flash images onto ROCK960 eMMC and reboot

Write the image to eMMC with the following command and address:

	rkdeveloptool wl 0 system.img

This will take a while, after it finishes, run

    rkdeveloptool rd

Now you reboot to the new image on eMMC.
